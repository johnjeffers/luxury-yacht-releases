## Feedback

Please open an issue to leave feedback.

I ask that you please keep a few things in mind:

1. Be nice! I'm in the early stages of beta testing. Stuff will be broken. I'll fix it as quickly as I can.
1. I'm just one person, and this is a side project, not my day job.
1. I have a lot of plans for the app that aren't implemented yet, and will take some time to get there.

## Q&A

#### Why Luxury Yacht?
I wanted a name that was fun, maybe even a little dumb, and had the nautical tie-in with Kubernetes, but wasn't another "K" name. Also, it's a deep-cut Monty Python reference, which makes me happy.

#### Why does this exist?
I don't really love any of the existing products in this space. [k9s](https://github.com/derailed/k9s/) is pretty good, but sometimes you want a GUI. I liked [Infra](https://infra.app), but it hasn't been updated in years. So I decided to build my own, that works exactly the way I want. Along the way, I thought it was getting good enough that other people might also like it.

#### Are you going to charge money for this?
Honestly, I don't know yet. Maybe. But if I do, it'll be very reasonable, and it won't be a subscription. I'm not trying to get rich off of this, but it would be nice to recoup the time I put into it.

#### Where's the source code?
In a private repo. I'm not open-sourcing it because I'm not sure yet if I want to make it a commercial app. I figure that's preferable to making it open-source, and then pulling the rug later if I change my mind.

#### Why do the betas expire?
Well, they're betas. I don't want them in the wild for too long. When it expires, go to the [Releases](https://github.com/johnjeffers/luxury-yacht-releases/releases) page to get the latest beta.

#### Will the betas auto-update?
Unfortunately, no. The [framework](https://wails.io) I decided on for the app doesn't support auto-update, yet.

#### How long will this be in beta?
Don't know. As long as it takes to get something I feel is releasable as a v1.

#### Why are the betas Mac only?
Because I use a Mac, so that's what got built first. I do intend to release for other platforms and architectures eventually.
